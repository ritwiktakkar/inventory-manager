# inventory-manager
An offline inventory management system implemented using C++

What does the project do?
-------------------------
With the implementation of my inventory management system, it will become much easier for me to log in whatever possessions/items of mine I have and wish to
store over the summer. Luckily, this is not the only application of an inventory system. Suppose you control the supplies of an office or factory, it would be
essential for you to know what all is in your current inventory.
